  abstract = {Introduction  1.1 Overview  Poststratification and weighting are used to adjust for known or expected discrepancies between sample and population. In this chapter, we aim to review current methods for using these techniques in survey analysis, and to critically examine the methods in the context of new ideas for extending model-based (Bayesian) methods to handle some of the more difficult problems that arise in practice. In particular, we distinguish among several different types of weights that are commonly used and clarify the relationship between poststratification and weighting. Difficulties that arise with these concepts motivate further development of the model-based poststratification approach (Holt and Smith, 1979; Little, 1991, 1993), which is usefully linked to the more traditional approaches via what we call the basic poststratification identity. Some progress is illustrated with examples, and the need for further development of these ideas is emphasized.  We},
